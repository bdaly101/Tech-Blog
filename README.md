# Tech-Blog

## Description

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog is an immersive project aimed at creating a CMS-style blog site, akin to WordPress, where developers can not only share their insights, articles, and blog posts but also engage with content published by their peers. This endeavor requires building the site from the ground up and deploying it on Heroku, adhering to the MVC architectural pattern for a structured and efficient development process. The application leverages Handlebars.js for its templating engine, Sequelize as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to facilitate database interactions, and the express-session npm package to manage authentication sessions securely.

This project serves as a platform for developers who are passionate about tech to vocalize their thoughts, share developments, and contribute to the ever-evolving discourse in the tech community. It emphasizes the importance of a shared space for writing and discussing technological advancements, coding tutorials, and personal experiences in software development. The Tech Blog site is designed to welcome users with a homepage showcasing existing posts, offer intuitive navigation between the homepage, dashboard, and user authentication options, and provide a user-friendly interface for posting new content, commenting on posts, and interacting with the developer community. Deploying such a comprehensive application showcases a developer's capability to integrate complex functionalities like user authentication, content management, and community engagement within a single, cohesive web application.
